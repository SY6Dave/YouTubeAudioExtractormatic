This is a wip upgrade to my first YouTubePlaylistDownloader, as that mysteriously stopped working as a result of external libraries I was using.

Uses FFMpeg which is licensed under GPL v2.1, and also uses libvideo which is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.

This application therefore also falls under BSD 2-clause, the full definition of which is below:
